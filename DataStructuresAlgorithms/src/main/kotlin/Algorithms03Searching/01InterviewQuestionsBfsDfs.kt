//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS: pass through every node level by level, useful for closer nodes

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// BFS: DFS would take a long of time
// DFS: use less memory

//If the tree is very wide:
// DFS: use less memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS: i know where the solutions are

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS: let us store any node's path

//Finding the shortest path:
// BFS: pass through all nodes level by level, so it will find the shortest path
